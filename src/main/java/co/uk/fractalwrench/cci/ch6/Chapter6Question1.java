     * Question: you have 20 bottles of pills, 19 of which have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills weighing 1.1 grams.
     * Given a perfect scale, how would the heavy bottle be detected by using the scale only once?
     *
     * As the scale can only be used once it will be necessary to weigh at least 19 of the bottles to distinguish the
     * one containing heavy pills.
     *
     * Each bottle should be labelled 1-n. For each bottle n pills should be placed on the scale. This means that
     * n heavy pills will be placed on the scale, causing a weight discrepancy of 0.1 * n grams. This discrepancy
     * will allow the bottle containing the heavy pills to be detected.
     *
     * This solution assumes that each bottle contains at least n pills.
